# License This!

Simple cross platform shell script that can add license information to the current directory with a:

Mac/Linux:
```
./license-this.sh
```

or 

Windows:
```
license-this.ps1
```

Creates a `LICENSE` file in the current directory, if one does not exist. Will also
create a `README.md` with short license information if one does not exist.  If one does
it will prompt you to add short license info at end of file.

## Usage

Set your license information by editing the script variables at the top.
